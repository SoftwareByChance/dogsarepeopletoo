  their spread. Usually the procedure is handled by a healthcare professional,
  but it couldn't hurt to have your dog know how it's done. "

steps:
  - Check if your dog can read. This isn't strictly required, but it'll help in
    telling the vaccinations apart. *
  - Open the package and have your dog identify whether the vaccine is to be
    administered orally (swallowed) or injected. There should be a picture of a
    mouth or a needle somewhere on the package. It's important not to mix them
    up!
  - Have your dog show the label to the intended vaccine recipient and tap on it
    so they are aware of any potential complications.
  - "If your dog is licensed to practice medicine in this state, have them point
    to their medical license on the wall. (Note: now is a good time to hang it
    up if you haven't done so yet). *"
  - If the patient is nervous, it is expected that your dog will tell a joke.
    Have them say "this won't hurt a bit". (Step assumes your dog knows how to
    speak.) *
  - Now it's time to vaccinate. If the vaccine is injectable, have your dog
    stick the syringe into the patient and depress the plunger. Otherwise, the
    contents of the syringe should be squirted into the mouth.
  - That's it! Your dog is now able to keep us a little bit healthier!
