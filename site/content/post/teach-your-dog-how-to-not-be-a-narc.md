steps:
  - Tell your dog to be cool.
  - Remind your dog that they are a dog, not a rat.
  - "Ask them if they always do everything their parents tell them. "
  - Try roleplaying with your dog; say that if they were in your shoes that you
    wouldn't tell on them.
  - Let your dog know that they're already implicated and you'd both get in
    trouble if they told on you.
  - Now hopefully your dog understands the importance of not being a snitch.
