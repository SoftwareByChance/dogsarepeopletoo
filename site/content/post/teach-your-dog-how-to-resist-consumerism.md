description: Commerce is all around us. Lurking around every gentrified corner
  is a boutique fromagerie. Behind every "helpful link" is a referral code
  waiting for checkout. If your dog is looking for a way to cut back on the urge
  to spend and mindless browsing, review the tips below to give their purse a
  break.

steps:
  - Avoid advertising. If your dog doesn't know about a product, then they can't
    buy it. Turn on an ad blocker in their browser to help.
  - Raise chickens and start a vegetable garden. Food is important for your dog.
    With chickens and a vegetable garden, they'll never need to order takeout
    again.
  - Stay hydrated. Thirst is the number one reason both dogs and humans purchase
    and consume fluids.
  - Buy in bulk. If your dog buys lots of items at once, it will reduce their
    frequency of purchases.
  - Teach them how to sew. If your dog wears pants, sewing is a great way to
    patch up any unintentional holes.
  - Try alternate forms of currency. If ease of credit cards are the issue, DIY
    cash is a great way for your dog to stop spending real money. Have fun with
    it :)
  - "Spread the word. If your dog is loud and proud about how they're better off
    by spending less, others will look up to them for their wisdom and your dog
    will grow a following. "
  - Leverage your dog's new-found influence. If your dog is popular enough,
    people will just give them things. They'll never need to spend their own
    money again!
