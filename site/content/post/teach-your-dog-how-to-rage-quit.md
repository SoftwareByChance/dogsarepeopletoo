description: Games usually serve as fun past-times, but they can be challenging
  and even a little frustrating at times. Follow the guide below to help your
  dog know when it's time to blow off a little steam.

steps:
  - Boot up your favorite gaming console or PC and jump into an online
    head-to-head game Halo 3, PUBG, or LoL. You and your dog can be on the same
    team.
  - Make sure you two warm-up with a few matches before getting serious. Don't
    worry about any losses since these are just for fun.
  - It'd be really nice to win one to start things off on a good foot, but this
    isn't the first time you've gone 0-3.
  - Maybe this next round you guys will finally get matched up with some decent
    teammates. Why does your team always suck?
  - Seriously?! Spawn camping? What are we, twelve? Can you believe this?
  - Alright, you and your dog should split up and be on different teams at this
    point. They aren't ranked as high as you so it might be affecting the
    matching algorithm or something.
  - "Did you see that?!?! That's the third time that guy got a head shot on you
    right through the freaking wall! He's hacking or using an aimbot or
    something. Tell him you're reporting him to Microsoft for hacking. Your dog
    should do the same. "
  - OK...OK... things are looking good this round. You got a sweet drop
    and...GAHH WHAT the HECK?! YOu pressed jump!
  - This isn't fair. You've been playing this game for way longer than any of
    these losers and cracked the top 500 twice. There's no way these guys are
    that good. Even your dog has a higher K:D than you right now...  and that
    guy just CLIPPED into the room from NOWHERE!!!
  - .....This is bullshit. Fuck this game. You're done with this. Sucks now
    anyway.
  - "Tell your dog to have fun playing that stupid game without you. People
    probably won't be playing it for much longer anyway with all those hackers.
    The devs don't care about the community anymore and it's driving away the
    players like you that made it fun in the first place. "
