description: Forensics is all about gathering evidence for the purposes of
  admission into court. If your dog is interested in putting criminals behind
  bars, one of the best ways to get their feet wet is by recreating the scene of
  a crime. Follow along below for a step-by-step.

steps:
  - The first thing you'll need is a crime. Rather than commit one of your own,
    it's often more informative to choose someone else's. Try visiting your
    local police precinct and asking to review crimes on file. Recent incidents
    will be easier to recreate but cold cases can be more fun!
  - Next up, you two will need supplies. In addition to a trip to the general
    store, take your dog to the art supplies store. They'll have an opportunity
    to flex their creative muscles, too!
  - "The final preparation is to choose a suitable spot. If the original
    location is available, do your best to gain access. Public places are ideal,
    but friends and family of those involved are often happy to help! "
  - "Now it's time to begin the recreation! Start by having your dog trace an
    outline of your body on the ground in chalk – any pose you like. This will
    be your centerpiece. "
  - 'Next, you and your dog should plant little numbered flags around the room
    next to bits of hair and pieces of broken glass. These are your "evidence".
    '
  - Now, you and your dog should measure all of the distances between the chalk
    outline and the pieces of evidence. It's important to use metric units since
    these are more scientific.
  - "Finally, take pictures of the scene from many different angles. Your dog
    can appear in some of them with a magnifying glass if they'd like, but it
    isn't necessary. "
  - And there you have it – crime scene recreated. Feel free to smoke a pipe or
    play a violin. At last, case closed!
