description: Have you heard? There's a Culture War a-brewing and we need all
  hands (and paws!) on-deck to fight for the future of this great world we call
  Earth. Below we'll cover the top things your dog will need in order to wage
  war effectively and ensure their kids learn the right history and values.

steps:
  - Pick a starting faction. Be sure your dog picks the right one.
  - Despite the popular narrative to the contrary, class and breed are largely
    determined by birth. Re-rolling your dog's gender is possible but may impact standing
    depending on the faction they chose in step 1.
  - Have your dog pick a specialization. "Social Media Amplifier" is an easy one to start with
    as it only requires a home computer and 56k modem.
  - Get informed. Be sure your dog has a position on Hillary Clinton, the shape
    of the Earth, and which is the correct way to cut a sandwich. Watch TikTok
    and YouTube for the latest in-group lingo and best opinions from your
    dog's faction's thought-leaders.
  - Neutrality is a no-go and the independent faction doesn't exist. If your dog wants to create satirical content and
    participate in the meta narrative the will require additional training.
  - Publicly calling someone out on social media for expressing an opinion is a great way to earn clout. Clout can
    be redeemed at the end of the war for fabulous prizes.
  - Don't let your dog engage with the other faction's media.
  - If another dog tries to take their stick ask them why they're avoiding the questions and won't agree to a debate.
  - Now your dog is ready for the frontline of the culture war. Let's get out
    there and win this thing!
