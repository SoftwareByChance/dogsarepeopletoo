description: Have you heard? There's a Culture War a-brewing and we need all
  hands (and paws!) on-deck to fight for the future of this great world we call
  Earth. Below we'll cover the top things your dog will need in order to wage
  war effectively and ensure their kids learn the right history and values.
steps:
  - Pick a starting faction. Despite the popular narrative to the contrary,
    class and race are largely determined by birth. Re-rolling gender is
    possible but may impact standing depending on your faction.
  - Pick a specialization. Clout can be redeemed at the end of the war for
    prizes.
