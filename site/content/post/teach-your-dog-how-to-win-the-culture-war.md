description: Have you heard? There's a Culture War a-brewing and we need all
  hands (and paws!) on-deck to fight for the future of this great world we call
  Earth. Below we'll cover the top things your dog will need in order to wage
  war effectively and ensure their kids learn the right history and values.

steps:
  - Pick a starting faction. Be sure your dog picks the right one.
  - Despite the popular narrative to the contrary, class and race are largely
    determined by birth. Re-rolling gender is possible but may impact standing
    depending on your faction.
  - Pick a specialization. "Social Media Amplifier" is an easy one to start with
    as it only requires a home computer and 56k modem.
  - Get informed. Be sure to have a position on Hillary Clinton. Watch TikTok
    and YouTube for the latest in-group lingo and best opinions from your
    faction's thought-leaders.
  - Neutrality is cringe. And so is satire and participating in the meta
    narrative. Anyone who identifies as an independent is actually a coward.
  - Publicly calling someone a "coward" is a great way to earn clout. Clout can
    be redeemed at the end of the war for prizes.
  - Don't engage with the other faction's media. It's all just just fake news
    and gotcha journalism anyway.
  - Bark softly and carry a big stick. If another dog tries to take the stick
    ask them why they're avoiding the questions and won't agree to a debate.
  - Now your dog is ready for the frontline of the culture war. Let's get out
    there and win this thing!

I believed that children were the future. But they had their chance. Now it's your dog's turn.
