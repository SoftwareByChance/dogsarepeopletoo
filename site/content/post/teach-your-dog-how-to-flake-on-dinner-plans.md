steps:
  - That walk earlier left your dog feeling totally exhausted. Who could blame
    them for bailing at the last minute?
  - Your dog has got their own shit going on and another night dealing with Jeff
    and Diane's whole situation just doesn't sound interesting. Pass.
  - Whoa, your dog's coworker just scored two Sturgill Simpson tickets. No time
    for dinner, they need to get ready!
  - Your dog just isn't feeling it tonight. Can they take a raincheck?
  - Dinner tonight just totally slipped your dogs mind.
  - Now your dog should know when it's acceptable to flake on dinner plans. And
    it's not really a big deal, other people are going to be there anyway.
