steps:
  - "Hello? Yeah I'd like to place an order for delivery. The address is 31
    Terrace Road, Unit 3. "
  - OK, I'd like one large half-cheese and half-pepperoni. Uh huh. And one large
    white veggie primo. Yup.
  - Oh, hang on, let me check. (Babe! Do you want garlic knots? OK.) Yeah, do
    you have ranch dipping sauce? Cool, yeah we'll do an order of the garlic
    things, too, then.
  - "Hey does Hairball still work there? Uhh, Harry. Yeah yeah! Tell him Ben
    says \"what's up\". Haha. "
  - Alright. Yeah, I'll just pay cash when they get here. Thirty minutes? Cool,
    sounds good. Thanks, you too. Bye.
