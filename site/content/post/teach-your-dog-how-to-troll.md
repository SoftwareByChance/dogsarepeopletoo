description: Trolling is a art — one of the oldest, in fact. Dating all the way
  back to the Usenet groups of the 1980s, trolls have garnered an esteemed place
  within discourse at the commons. This post will help you guide your dog on
  their way to becoming a feared and respected public contributor with this
  noble past-time.

steps:
  - "Have your dog pick a target and do some research. Get to know the
    subculture a bit: where do the members hang out, what's the lingo, who are
    the thought leaders, what are the sacred cows. Especially prickly groups
    make for an easier time."
  - 'Build a public profile on the site or forum. Your dog should put in a
    little effort to make it seem legit, but remember to have fun with it. Find
    some threads where the narrative is mainstream and bandwagon a bit with
    benign replies like "so true!" or "based". '
  - "Now that your dog has built up a bit of reputation it's time to get their
    hands dirty. Post an opinion that's a little outside the norm. For example:
    \"Hydration doesn't really matter in bread making since the dough's going in
    the oven anyway\". The bait has been laid. "
  - "Wait for the replies to roll in and then have your dog dig in a bit. Be
    sure to double-down, respond in a way that deliberately misses the point,
    and generally argue in bad faith. "
  - "BONUS: Your dog can really level-up their trolling chops by learning how to
    make memes or using sock-puppets to boost their signal on the platform."
  - That's it. And remember, if your dog gets a reaction out of the other
    person, they've already won.
