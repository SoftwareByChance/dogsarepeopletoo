  Even if your dog isn't technically a citizen, they should still know how to
  cast their ballot when the time comes.

*(This guide assumes paper mail-in ballot)*

1. Show your dog how to research candidates online on sites like Facebook and Reddit. 
2. Open the paper ballot and smooth it out so that your dog can see all of the names.
3. Using a number 2 pencil, help them fill out the bubble next to each name. Remember, if all of the bubbles aren't filled in then the ballot won't count!
4. Fold the ballot up and stuff it into the envelope. Your dog can lick the sticky part and apply the stamps. 
5. Take a walk to the nearest mail box and let your dog drop the sealed ballot into the box.
6. Apply an "I Voted" sticker to your dog's collar. Now they're a true patriot!
