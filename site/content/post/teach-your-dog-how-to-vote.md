description: Voting is one of the most important civic duties for an American.
  Even if your dog isn't technically a citizen, they should still know how to
  cast their ballot when the time comes.

steps:
  - Show your dog how to research candidates online on sites like Facebook and Reddit.
  - Open the paper ballot and smooth it out so that your dog can see all of the names.
  - Using a number 2 pencil, help them fill out the bubble next to each name. Remember, if all of the bubbles aren't filled in then the ballot won't count!
  - Fold the ballot up and stuff it into the envelope. Your dog can lick the sticky part and apply the stamps.
  - Take a walk to the nearest mail box and let your dog drop the sealed ballot into the box.
  - Apply an "I Voted" sticker to your dog's collar. Now they're a true patriot!
